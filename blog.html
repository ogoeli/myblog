       A very quick one (more like my rant on whatsapp),i just wanted to share my displeasure.My sister and I after dressing sweetly in our nike shoes we got as christmas gifts from our dad,went to a health facility today after school.We sat down waiting patiently to be called.Two asian looking women came in, one was aged and the other seemed like her daughter.The younger one went in to the counter while the older woman wanted to sit close to my sister ,then she looked up aaaaaand saw my sister  and she moved to another sit near some mexican kids.Then she kept her face like agidi that soaked water.My sister and i were still trying to take that in then her daughter came and wanted to sit on that same sit .She looked up too and saw my sister then she moved away and stood by the door,when there were two chairs by my sisters right and left-hand side.</p>

      <p>After a while,she came and sat down in a very funny way at the edge of the of the chair like she was wanted .My sister and i started laughing and we both said 'double wahala for dead body'.I kept looking at her and it made her more uncomfortable.They couldnt talk or even sneeze.</p>

     <p>Image if my sister and i were not comfortable in our own skin or we had a problem with being black they would have would have won the battle.Hehehe they met the Ekwegh girls,fearless and confident to the brim.We no dey shake one bit and their case was no exceptional today.I wrote my final exams on trigometry today with a heart full of joy,i went to the place and they wanted to kill my joy,but God pass them,they met their matches.Be you,own your color and be proud of who you are.I am black nobody can make me uncomfortable because of my color.Dont let people that need melanin make you feel less of who you are.It is no sin to be black and if i was to choose.I would choose black always any day.Black is beautiful,be black,love black

      <p>Welcome back y'all,sorry for the delay.This school want to kill me,but God pass them.I appericate your responses and i am back with the rest.Another gist from school was when i took a speech class.Were four nigerians and we couldnt even hide.The lecturer was a strange person more like a pshycho,he clearly told us that he didnt like humans and that we shouldnt contact him even through Email.He didnt even say anything related to the course,he even told us the attandance is not compulsory.We struggled to keep up with the class and the man was not even helping,he still gave my sister and I B even when we were supposed to have an A because we keep track of scores</p>
      <p>We attend catholic church here and we have a community here that is our masses are said in igbo.Nice right? not totally oh because these people just come to show off clothes,wigs,makeups and titles.Even the youths especially the girls,the girls dress so indecent</p>

      <p>In 2018,I learnt to be much more patient,I learnt to guide my personal space because depression is real,i learnt to appreecaite myself and not let anyone make me feel less,i learnt to trust God and trust the process,i learnt to take life one day at a time,i learnt a lot in 2018 and it was worth it and guess what i found <strong>a gem...</strong></p>
